#Instructions
1) Compile with 'make' or 'make malloc'
   This builds from source files and creates an archive (libmalloc.a), 
   a library to link to.
2) If target intel-all ('make intel-all') is specified a 32-bit and a 64-bit
   shared library will be built


#Other Information
Concerning Debugging output: Whenever calloc or realloc is called they will use
malloc as their memory allocator, size allocated will not be available for 
malloc or calloc after the return from malloc, which means a call to one of
them will first produce debugging output to malloc, and afterwards calloc or
realloc.

Concerning returning memory to kernel when large chunks become free, the
solution is not lost on me, I just did not have enough time to implement it.
There is a place holder (in comments) in malloc.h which should do the trick 
but has not been tested.
